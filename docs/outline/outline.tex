This project aims to examine existing Version Control Systems (VCS), and to utilise that research to create a new VCS\@.
\section*{Plan}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{October}: Research existing Version Control Systems, take note of their history, design, strengths and weaknesses.
    \item \textbf{Novemeber}: Research common designs and implementations for Version Control Systems. Take note of the design aims, data structures, algorithms, and specific nuances of each.
    \item \textbf{December}: Begin planning and designing my own Version Contriol System. Consider the target audience, the core features, and the potential pitfalls of specific designs.
    \item \textbf{January}: Begin implementing my Version Control System. Voice any concerns or issues with the design.
    \item \textbf{February}: Evaluate the progress of the implementation. Consider the strengths and weaknesses of the design, compare the viability of specific algorithms and features.
    \item \textbf{March}: Analyse the results of the evaluation, create visualisations of the results, and voice thoughts on said results.
    \item \textbf{April}: Create a conclusion, summarise the results, and voice any final thoughts. Comment on possible future work, consider differing opions on prior decisions, reflect on the project as a whole.
    \item \textbf{May}: Finalise the report.
\end{itemize}
