\section{Existing Version Control Systems}
\subsection{Concurrent Versions System (CVS)}
Concurrent Versions System (CVS) was developed in the 1980s by Larry Wall and was the first VCS to become widely used for collaborative software development. Concurrent Versions System is a centralized VCS, meaning that there is a single server that stores the entire history of the project. The server is the only place where files can be added, removed or modified.
